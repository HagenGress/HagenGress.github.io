<!--- designed and fabricated molds for ultrasonic hot embossing
- used ultrasonic hot embossing and ultrasonic welding to create the microchannels
- integrated CNC-milled aluminum inlays for temperature control via Joule heating
- designed and built a test fixture for easy integration with the experimental setup
- used Raman spectroscopy to evaluate the performance of the diffusion experiments
